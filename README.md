# VSC Snippets
Useful code snippets that I frequently use in VSC with added batch install script for windows devices.

# Download
```
git clone https://github.com/DravenMainBTW/VSC-Snippets.git
```

# Setup
**Important Note:** if you plan on adding the snippets via the install script it will only work on windows machines and if cloned to the same drive that your AppData folder is stored in.


### Using Install Script
Either open a terminal in the repo and run:
```
install.bat
```
Or open the repo in file explorer and run `install.bat`.


### Installing Manually
Copy the file `VSCSNIPPETS-V1.code-snippets` in this repo to where you VSC snippets are stored. An example of the pathway on windows:

```
C:\Users\[ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets
```
